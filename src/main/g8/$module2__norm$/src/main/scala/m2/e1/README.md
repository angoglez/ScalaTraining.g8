#[Milestone 2] Exercise 1 - Basic polymorphism

**Objective**

Use polymorphism to implement a binary tree supporting at least `String`, `Int`, `Char`.

For the `String` case, we will place it on alphabetical order.

**Extra kudos**

1) make it supporting all basic types(avoiding list, option, either and so on).
2) Include support for `Option`.

**Expected**

* Solution design.
* Tests covering functionality.
