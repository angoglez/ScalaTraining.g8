_Our suggestions for getting started_

We’ve designed this guide to act as a path for learning the essential skillsets that every Scala Engineer within 47 Degrees should know.

Depending on your experience and background, you may be able to skip some of the sections posted below.

While we've set up some suggested time frames for completing each section, you can personally discuss and firm up a timeline with your Principal or Mentor.

## Learning Resources

The following resources can help you complete the milestones and serve as an aid in addition to any on-site training you'll be receiving from your Mentor or other engineers on the team.

* [Scala Exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/)
* [Functional Programming in Scala Specialization - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala)
* [Training Repo](https://github.com/47deg/trainings)
* [Minerva](https://github.com/47deg/Minerva)
* [Scala Tutorials](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/)
* [FP Fundamentals](https://github.com/47deg/fp-fundamentals)

There are a lot more resources you can use, but we don't want to overwhelm you. Please don't hesitate to ask your Mentor for additional resources on a specific topic.

## Milestone 0: Learning Git / GitHub

### Duration

1 week.

### Overview
 **Git** serves as our version control system, and more importantly, is the basis for the entire organization of 47 Degrees. Therefore, this is the very first thing you need to learn. While you don’t need to become an expert, it’s crucial that you understand the basics:
* Get git
* Repositories
* Commits
* Set up GitHub
* Remotes
* Forks and clones
* Branches
* Pull
* Pull Requests
* Merge and solving conflicts


### Practice
 
  [Here](https://github.com/47deg/trainings/tree/scalatraining-improvement/scala-improved/milestone%200) you will find a guide to learn all the concepts covered above and get familiar with Git/GitHub while setting up everything to continue working on the next milestones.
 


## Milestone 1: Introduction to Scala and its Environment

### Duration

3-5 weeks.

### Overview



To complete this milestone, you'll need to have an understanding of the following:

* **SBT**: https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/index.html . Install and setup the Scala Build Tool. It requires Java 1.8 or later.
* **Scala REPL or Ammonite**: during this learning process it's crucial that you're able to run the Scala REPL to test and try out Scala code on your laptop. We suggest [Ammonite](https://ammonite.io/), a Modernized Scala REPL.
* **Scala Basic Concepts**
    * Basics: expressions, values, variables, blocks, functions, methods, classes, case classes, objects, traits, main method.
    * Scala Type Hierarchy
    * Classes
    * Traits
    * Class Composition with Mixins
    * Higher-order Functions
    * Nested Methods
    * Currying
    * Case Classes
    * Pattern Matching
    
### Practice
At the end of this milestone, you will need to demonstrate that you have assimilated all of the concepts and tools covered above and, that you will be able to use them in practice, by completing a series of [exercises](https://github.com/47deg/trainings/tree/scalatraining-improvement/scala-improved/milestone%201).


## Milestone 2: Going deeper in Scala

### Duration

2-4 weeks.

### Overview

* **Scala in Deep**:
    * Singleton Objects
    * Regular Expression Patterns
    * Extractor Objects
    * For Comprehensions
    * Generic Classes
    * Variances
    * Upper Type Bounds
    * Lower Type Bounds
    * Inner Classes
    * Abstract Types
    * Compound Types
    * Self-type
    * Implicit Parameters
    * Implicit Conversions
    * Polymorphic Methods
    * Local Type Inference
    * Operators
    * By-name Parameters
    * Annotations
    * Default Parameter Values
    * Named Arguments

### Practice
At the end of this milestone, you will need to demonstrate that you have assimilated all of the concepts and tools covered above and, that you will be able to use them in practice, by completing a series of [exercises](https://github.com/47deg/trainings/tree/scalatraining-improvement/scala-improved/milestone%202).

## Milestone 3: Scala and Functional Programming

Scala is a functional programming language in the sense that every function is a value. As you have seen, Scala provides a lightweight syntax for defining anonymous functions, supports higher-order functions, allows functions to be nested, and supports currying. These, among other features, make Scala a good programming language for FP.

### Duration

3-5 weeks.

### Overview

As part of this Milestone, you will be introduced to some FP concepts by using [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/), one of the most popular libraries in Scala, which provides abstractions for functional programming in Scala.

* Typeclasses
* Introduction to Cats
* Monoids and Semigroups
* Functors
* Monads
* Monad Transformers
* Applicative
* Foldable and Traverse


### Practice
At the end of this milestone, you will need to demonstrate that you have assimilated all of the concepts and tools covered above and, that you will be able to use them in practice, by completing a series of [exercises](https://github.com/47deg/trainings/tree/scalatraining-improvement/scala-improved/milestone%203).


## Milestone 4: Advanced Scala and FP

### Duration

2-4 weeks.

### Overview

* Tagless Final
* Programming with Effects
    * F-Algebras
    * Introduction to cats-effect
    * Error Handling


### Practice
At the end of this milestone, you will need to demonstrate that you have assimilated all of the concepts and tools covered above and, that you will be able to use them in practice, by completing a series of [exercises](https://github.com/47deg/trainings/tree/scalatraining-improvement/scala-improved/milestone%204).


## Milestone 5: Functional Frameworks in Scala and Final Project

This is the last milestone! Outside of the technical topics that you'll learn in this section, we'll start defining some of the consulting practices that you might have read about in the [Culture book](https://github.com/47deg/47-process/blob/master/consulting-handbook/consulting-handbook.md).

### Duration

4-6 weeks.

### Overview

* Mu
* Http4s
* Circe
* Doobie
* fs2
    

### Project
At the end of this milestone, you will need to design and develop a [project](https://github.com/47deg/trainings/tree/scalatraining-improvement/scala-improved/milestone%205) from scratch, by using all the knowledge obtained in the sections above. This is your chance to put all of the concepts you've learned in these milestones into practice.
